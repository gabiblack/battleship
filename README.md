Full Stack Battlship application

# Battleship

In this project I am creating a Full-Stack application recreating the game Battleship following the rules as found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).
## About this problem

### Rules of the Game

1. It is a 2 player game.

2. Each Player has two boards, one for their own ships, and another to track shots fired. Each board is of size 10x10.

3. Each player can place 5 ships on his board:
    - Carrier of length 5
    - Battleship of length 4
    - Cruiser of length 3
    - Submarine of length 3
    - Destroyer of length 2
   
4. Players take turns firing missiles at the opposing player. If the missile hits a ship, then both players are informed of a hit, otherwise they are both informed that it missed. If all the spots on a ship are hit, then the ship is sunk.

5. The first player to sink all 5 ships of their opponent wins the game.
